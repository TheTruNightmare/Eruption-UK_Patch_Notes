**--------- New Content! (Lost Souls) ---------**

We are pleased to announce the new major update known as the Lost Souls update, with this update we are completely re-writing the way in which you can obtain mob spawners within the game by adding our own soul system in which killing a mob has a set chance to drop a soul of its own type. this can then be combined with soul shards which can either be traded for OR obtained from naturally generated spawners, hopefully this brings a new value to mob spawners and makes them a bit more sought after!
